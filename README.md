# JavaFootball
Java meets the gridiron! Play and simulate American football games and seasons.

This is a custom-built game for playing and simulating American football games and seasons – professional or collegiate – a mix of Madden and a board game.

The game is inspired by Madden and NCAA Football video games, and a board game called NFL Game Day. The program is basically a hybrid between the two.

COMING DECEMBER 2018 - JANUARY 2019...
